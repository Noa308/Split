Excited to share my latest full-stack project: Split! 🚀
Over the past few weeks, I developed "Split", a full-stack application that allowed me to deepen my skills and work with the following technologies:
🔹 React
🔹 PostgreSQL
🔹 Express.js
🔹 Tailwind CSS
🔹 JavaScript
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of building robust APIs, connecting the backend (PostgreSQL & Express.js) seamlessly with the frontend (React), and enhancing the UI with Tailwind and CSS. I also gained hands-on experience in managing state, routing, and designing intuitive user experiences.
🎯 Key Takeaways:
🔹Building APIs and optimizing database queries.
🔹Developing modular and maintainable code.
🔹Designing responsive and clean interfaces with Tailwind CSS.
